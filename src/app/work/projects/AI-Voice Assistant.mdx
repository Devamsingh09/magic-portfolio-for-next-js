## Overview

In this project, I developed an **AI-powered voice assistant** that enables seamless human-computer interaction using **speech recognition, natural language understanding (NLU), and text-to-speech synthesis**. The assistant can perform various tasks like answering questions, providing weather updates, setting reminders, and even controlling smart devices.

## Key Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Uses Whisper AI and Google Speech-to-Text API for accurate real-time speech recognition.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Implements NLP models with **spaCy** and **Dialogflow** to understand user intent and context.
- **Voice Response**: Integrates text-to-speech (TTS) with **gTTS and ElevenLabs API** for natural-sounding responses.
- **Task Automation**: Capable of setting reminders, fetching news updates, controlling IoT devices, and executing system commands.
- **Customizable Wake Word**: Uses **Porcupine Wake Word Engine** to activate the assistant without manual input.
- **Multilingual Support**: Enables interaction in multiple languages with translation APIs.

## Technologies Used

- **Python & FastAPI**: Backend server for request handling and processing.
- **Whisper AI & Google Speech API**: For high-accuracy speech recognition.
- **Dialogflow & spaCy**: For natural language understanding and intent classification.
- **gTTS & ElevenLabs**: For converting text responses into natural-sounding speech.
- **PyAudio & SpeechRecognition**: For capturing and processing voice input.
- **MQTT & Home Assistant API**: For smart home integrations.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the major challenges was optimizing real-time **speech recognition latency** while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, fine-tuning NLP models to handle **context switching** and **multi-turn conversations** required significant effort. Implementing wake-word detection efficiently without high power consumption was another key learning area.

## Outcome

The AI Voice Assistant enables hands-free interaction, automates tasks, and enhances accessibility for users. This project showcases **the power of voice-driven AI** in everyday applications, from productivity enhancement to smart home automation.
