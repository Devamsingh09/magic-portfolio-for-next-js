Campus Navigation: Provides directions to buildings, departments, and facilities.

Event Notifications: Keeps students updated about upcoming university events, deadlines, and announcements.

Administrative Support: Assists with tasks such as fee inquiries, exam schedules, and hostel applications.

24/7 Availability: Offers real-time assistance, reducing dependency on manual administrative support.

Technologies Used

Dialogflow: For natural language understanding and chatbot development.

FastAPI: To handle webhook requests and integrate with university databases.

Google Colab: For training and fine-tuning AI models.

Railway & Netlify: For seamless deployment of backend and frontend components.

Firebase: To store user interactions and maintain session continuity.

Challenges and Learnings

Building CampusBot involved overcoming challenges like ensuring high response accuracy, managing diverse query intents, and integrating multiple data sources efficiently. Training the chatbot to handle ambiguous queries while maintaining a natural conversation flow was a key focus. Additionally, optimizing the API responses for faster query resolution helped enhance user experience.

Outcome

CampusBot has significantly reduced the time students spend searching for information, leading to better engagement and smoother campus experiences. Its ability to provide instant, accurate answers has made it a valuable digital assistant for universities.
