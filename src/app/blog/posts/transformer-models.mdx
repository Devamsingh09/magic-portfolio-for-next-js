Introduction
Transformer models have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning. From BERT to GPT, these architectures power modern AI applications such as chatbots, translation systems, and text summarization tools. But what makes transformers so powerful?

How Transformers Work
Transformers rely on the attention mechanism, specifically self-attention, to process input sequences in parallel rather than sequentially like RNNs. This enables better context understanding and faster training times.

Key Components of Transformers:

Self-Attention Mechanism: Helps the model focus on relevant words in a sentence.

Positional Encoding: Adds sequence order information.

Multi-Head Attention: Allows the model to understand different aspects of the input.

Feed-Forward Networks: Further processes the contextual embeddings.

Real-World Applications

Chatbots and virtual assistants

Machine translation (e.g., Google Translate)

Text summarization tools

Code generation and AI-driven writing assistants
